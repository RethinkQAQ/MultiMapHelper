# Description
This is a simple plugin designed to help multi-world map mods select the corresponding world. 
It retrieves the world name set by the proxy server and sends it to the client, allowing the client to choose the appropriate world.
> For now, it just works, and improvements will be made later.

> MapModCompanion works better than this plugin, so I recommend using it instead.
